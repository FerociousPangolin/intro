Hey all,

My name is Nikos,

For the last couple of years, I have been working as a **technical writer**, primarily using a docs-as-code approach for documentation.

I am familiar with 

- LaTeX, 
- Markdown, and 
- Python, among other markup and programming languages.

In my spare time, I conduct research for my PhD studies ([Information Management Research Lab](https://iml.alis.uniwa.gr/)) in Information Science. More specifically, I collect online news articles, exploring their text for various similarity patterns.
