Hi,

I am Nick and for the last couple of years I have been working as a *technical writer*, primarily using a docs-as-code approach for documentation.

I am familiar with: 

- LaTeX, 
- Markdown, and 
- Python, among other markup and programming languages.

In my spare time, I conduct research for my PhD studies in Information Science, at the ([Information Management Research Lab](https://iml.alis.uniwa.gr/)), University of West Attica, Greece. 

More specifically, I collect online news articles, exploring their text to uncover various similarity patterns.
