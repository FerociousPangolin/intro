Hello,

My name is Nikos,

For the last couple of years, I have been working as a *technical writer*, primarily using docs-as-code approach for documentation.

I am familiar with *LaTeX*, *Markdown*, and *Python*, among other markup and programming languages.

In my spare time, I conduct research for my PhD in Information Science. More specifically, I am collecting and analyzing online news articles for similarity patterns.
