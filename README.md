Hey all,

My name is Nick. 

I am currently working as a technical writer, primarily using DITA XML for documentation.

In my free time, I am doing research and writing articles for my Phd.

I am interested in learning Markdown, and get involved in opensource projects.

Also, I am keen in developing inclusive, accessible and sustainable documentation.

You can reach me here at Github.
